## Quick Summary
Is True is infrastructure that enables distributed fact checking. By enabling users to know at a glance whether information is true and whether a source should be trusted, we create a shared reality. The user interface is a browser extension.

## Need
People want to know whether information is true, and whether a source should be trusted. Whether it's buying a product, deciding how to handle Covid-19, or choosing a political candidate, people want the truth.

She clicks a link to see why her brother trusts The Lancet.

Making the corect decision about which information to believe is the difference between life and death with regards to Covid-19, and
