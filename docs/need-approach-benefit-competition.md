## Quick Summary
Is True is infrastructure that enables distributed fact checking. By enabling users to know at a glance whether information is true and whether a source should be trusted, we create a shared reality. The user interface is a browser extension.

## Need
People want to know whether information is true, and whether a source should be trusted. Whether it's buying a product, deciding how to handle Covid-19, or choosing a political candidate, people want the truth. 

Unfortunately, sophiticated marketers and algorithms have bombarded us with disinformation, usually so that the information source can monetive our attention. 

## Approach
Is True is a browser extension. When a user sign up, they select websites and social media profiles of people they trust. This creates their Trust Network.

Then, when the person visits a website, Is True tells uses the Trust Nemork to tell the user whether the website or news source is trustworthy.

For example, a user sees a post from New York Times on Twitter. When she visits the website, she sees that her brother, whom she trusts, trust the New York Times.
