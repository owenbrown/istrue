## IsTrue
_Start with a hook. Write something compelling or no-one will read this._

Is True facilitates distributed fact checking for individuals and organizations. 

### How does this work?

During account creation, new users select people and organizations who they trust. This creates the user's _Trust Network_.

A user install a broswer extension. Each time a user visits a domain, browser extension queries the users Trust Network to look for annotations about the specific article and the source of the article. 

### What is a Trust Network?
The Trust Network is a list of people and organizations that a users trusts, and the people and organizations that those people trust.
For example, I'm a user. I trust my brother. My brother trusts the New York Times. Therefore, the New York Times is in my Trut Graph. When I visit the New York Times website, Is True indicates that they are in my Trust Network. 


### Transmitting each page URL invades users privacy
The initial implementation is focused on simplicity. New ideas are fragile, and it's important that we create a proof-of-concept as quickly as possible. We respect users privacy security and will find a way protect both.
