## Is True

Is True facilitates distributed fact checking for individuals and organizations. 

### How does this work?

During account creation, new users select people and organizations who they trust. This creates the user's _Trust Network_.

A user install a broswer extension. Each time a user visits a domain, browser extension queries the users Trust Network to look for annotations about the specific article and the source of the article. 

### What is a Trust Network?
The Trust Network is a list of people and organizations that a users trusts, and the people and organizations that those people trust.
For example, I'm a user. I trust my brother. My brother trusts the New York Times. Therefore, the New York Times is in my Trut Graph. When I visit the New York Times website, Is True indicates that they are in my Trust Network. 


### Transmitting each page URL invades users privacy
The initial implementation is focused on simplicity. New ideas are fragile, and it's important that we create a proof-of-concept as quickly as possible. We respect users privacy security and will find a way protect both.

### Should this exist?
I don't know. Between 90% and 99% of new software projects shouldn't exist, because they don't solve a deep a and compelling problem for anyone.
I've [created a page](need-approach-benefit-competition) to try to answer this question. 

In the run up to the 2020 United States presidential election, I maintained a dialogue with a friend whose news sources were extremely different than mine. I spent many night reading and researching the articlse he sent me. Through careful analysis I as often able to show that the article was either a complete fabrication, or was carefully constructed to both be shared virally on social media while deliberatly leading its audience to believe something untrue.  

I was frustrated that it took hours to produce this high-quarity research, but that research would only be read by one person. I wondered, how can our society survice this flood of dis-information, whn it takes hours to debunk fake news but only a few seconds to re-post a lie?

### Next Steps
I'm a software developer who loves building things, so my instinct is to build proof-of-concept. However, the product manager and former start-up founder in me knows that there are faster ways to determine whether this is worth working on.

It's hard to *Make Something People Want*. I don't know if people want this or will use it. 

This product solves two separate problems for two seperate people. It relies on a passionate 1% oy users who care enough about the truth to write clear, carefully researched reports about why a fake news should be viewed as such. It then also relies on the other 99% users actually wanting to know what is true.
