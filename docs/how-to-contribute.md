# How to contribute
We're searching for people who are passionate about using technology to create a shared reality that is free of disinformation.

We're still searching for a problem and solution that creates deep and compelling value. 

To prioritize and track our work, we use GitHub issues. Check out [our issue board](https://github.com/owenbrown/istrue/issues).

If an issue exists describing the work you're interested in doing, consider commenting in issue. When you've completed the work, put in a pull request.

If there's something new you'd like to add, create an issue.

You're invited to also edit our website directly, without using an issue.
